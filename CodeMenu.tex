* CfgAliases::	@strong{Command line utility to configure the /etc/aliases file:}  This script makes it easy to manage and update the /etc/aliases file. 

* CfgNamed::	

* sys::	

* CfgArgs::	@strong{Command line parser:} This is a module to help parse standard configuration utility command lines. 

* Cfgfile::	@strong{Generic interface to configuration files:} a tie hash / object to allow accessing and modify text-based configuration files.  This even allows the files to be checked in and out of a revision control system automatically. 

* filever::	@strong{File version controls:} This is a simple PERL assist module for controlling the version of a text file.  It does not replace any RCS or CVS interface, but simply makes a back up copy in a safe and sane way. 

* TieAliases::	@strong{Mail aliases associative array:} A tie hash to allow using & modifying the mail aliases file (/etc/aliases) 

* TieGeneric::	@strong{Generic associative array of configuration information:}  This is a tie that automatically ties in the other configuration associative arrays. 

* TieGroup::	@strong{Group associative arrays:} This is a tie hash that associates a group name or id with the other information about that group of people.  It is designed to help make the user group database easy to access. 

* TieHost::	@strong{Host name associative arrays:} This is a tie to make the network hosts tables easy to access. 

* TieNamed::	@strong{BIND Domain Name Server (named) configuration module:} This is a tie hash of tie hashes that allow the named daemon to be configured on the fly, and to help keep its configuration up to date. 

* TieNet::	@strong{Network address associative array:} This is a tie hash that translates a network address into a network name and vice-versa. 

* TiePh::	@strong{Phonebook (ph) server configuration module:} This is an associative array that can be used to configure the ph server in unix. 

* TieProto::	@strong{Procotol name associative array:} This is a tie hash that associates a protocol name with its number. 

* TieRCService::	This is a PERL module to interact with tradition UNIX /etc/rc.d services 

* TieServ::	@strong{Service port associative array:} This is a tie hash that associates a service name to its port number.  It is designed to make access and configuration of the services table easy. 

* TieShadow::	@strong{Shadow password file tie:}  This ties the shadow password file (/etc/shadow) into a PERL associative array. 

* TieUser::	@strong{User associative arrays:} This is a set of ties that associates a user name or id with the other information about that person.  It is designed to make the user database easy to access.

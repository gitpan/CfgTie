                [3]CfgTie:: A Configuration Interface thru Perl
                                       
Introduction

   CfgTie is a package of Perl modules and tools. These make it easier to
   configure and maintain Unix computers.
   
   The idea is that just about everything in your machines environment
   can -- nay should -- be operable thru a single consistent interface.
   This is a set of tools that make many of the various configuration
   subsystem in your machine appear to be Perl variables of some sort.
   (There are other modules available from CPAN for the other aspects of
   your environment).
   
  Problem Domain
  
   This module makes the configuration text files and subsystems
   available to Perl as conventional objects.
   
   These are mapped into Perl, usually as hash arrays, but providing
   object nethods where appropriate.
   
  Installation
  
   After unpacking the tar file, do:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
